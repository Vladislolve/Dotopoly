# Dotopoly
Standard Monopoly game with Dota theme

This mod as of right now follows the standard monopoly rules, though there's a couple of things 
that are not implemented and some others that can be tricky porting to the mod:
- The amount of wards(houses and hotels) that you can have in the game is unlimited.
	I'm not sure if it will be implemented into the mod, though it's an important part
	of the game.
- Players don't have to ask for payment, the game automatically adds and removes gold.
- A player with 0 gold is automatically removed from the game, without having the time
	to sell some of his properties.
- If a player lands on a street that is not in posession of any player, he has the right to
	buy it. If he doesn't buy it, the street should be auctioned. The auction system is not
	implemented right now, but it will probably, as it speeds up the game a whole lot.
- Other types of starting the game, like giving out streets to the players at the start
	of the game, are not implemented.

Other misc stuff, like game sounds or better interface, are to be expected soon.
